            The Belgian capital of Brussels was yesterday treated to a
            demonstration of German football as the national team defeated the
            home side by a surprisingly large 6-1 margin. The young Dortmunder
            August Lenz made an outstanding debut in Prof. Otto Nerz’s DFB
            eleven. Although he was patently new to the world of international
            football (his team Borussia Dortmund plays in division two) and
            although he scarcely knew the players he was playing with and
            although the German XI were often on the back foot, Lenz was
            always quick onto the ball in attack firing his fierce drives onto
            the Belgian goal throughout the game. <br /><br />Two such shots
            found their target, and at timely moments, too, when the German
            team needed a boost. The score line suggests at an easy win but
            the win was truly hard fought. The blond centre forward Lenz
            certainly fulfilled the high expectations expected of him. He is a
            natural worker and the two goals merely underlined the worth of
            his shooting prowess and quickness of thought when given a chance.
            It will not be the last time that August Lenz plays for the
            national team.
