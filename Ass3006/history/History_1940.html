              BVB beat Schalke 3-2 in Herne to become Westphalia champions
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Ten-time Westphalian champions Schalke 04 had to endure a bitter
            3-2 defeat at the hands of Borussia Dortmund at the Schloss
            Strunkede stadium in Herne yesterday. Goals from Michallek,
            Ruhmhofer and Sandmann gave BVB victory in the final of the
            Westphalian championship in front of 30,000 passionate fans. The
            win marked an end to Schalke’s dominance in the region. A goal
            from Michallek shortly after half-time nullified a Hinz goal from
            Schalke in the first half. However, shortly afterwards Kronsbein
            had to pick the ball out of the net again after a free-kick from
            Tibulski. Heinrich Ruhmhofer, up from defence, again equalised for
            BVB before, with just minutes left on the clock, 17-year-old
            Herbert Sandmann scored the winning goal. The travelling BVB fans
            did not let the pouring rain stop them from celebrating with their
            players. BVB first played a championship match against Schalke 04
            on 3 May 1925. The game, also in Herne, went to Schalke and won
            them a regional championship. Best Borussia player in the 4-2
            defeat was the ’keeper Knipprath who held all that he could.
            <br /><br />In the coming years BVB ran into a string of hefty
            defeats such as a 0-7 defeat in 1936-37 at the Rote Erde stadium
            or the 10-0 disaster at the Glueckauf-Kampfbahn ground. Kuzorra
            scored four of the goals in that game and future BVB coach Hermann
            Eppenhoff scored, too. Not until 1938 did BVB strike back when
            they won, albeit in the final of the A-youth Westphalia
            championship in Muenster with Max Michallek the best player in a
            4-2 win in Muenster. It was with his two goals in that game that
            he had people thinking that he could be one of the greats in the
            ’Black n Yellow‘ colours. It was not until 14 November 1943 that
            the BVB first team was able to win against Schalke. They won 1-0
            in a game at the Rote Erde stadium courtesy of an August Lenz
            goal. BVB confronted Schalke a total of 16 times in the regional
            leagues of Westphalia but could only manage one win and a draw in
            that time.

              Scandal: BVB denied the chance to play for German championship
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            „We do not recognise your dictatorial measures and will not play
            in Hannover on Sunday. Stop. We consider ourselves bound by the
            contractual requirements agreed in Braunschweig.“ With these firm
            words aimed at the haughty Zonal committee executive director A.
            Weber, BVB reacted angrily at the unsporting actions of the
            association. In BVB 1948 BVB were declared winners of the west
            German league ”Oberliga West“ and were looking forward to taking
            part on the Zonal Championship, the first ”German“ league since
            the war ended. BVB had beaten Werder Bremen in Hannover 3-2 aet,
            but Weber opined that BVB should now play St Pauli and not, as had
            been previously planned, Braunschweig. Weber also pushed through
            as the date of the game to be the 8th of May rather than the 9th,
            so on a work day. This was only made known to BVB on the 5th of
            May. It needs to be noted that the entire BVB team is employed and
            would have had to ask for extra leave from their employers, hence
            the telegram. The association response was: ”Borussia Dortmund
            have decided not to follow the timetable and game plan laid out by
            the Zonal committee and will therefore be excluded from the German
            championship. TSV Braunschweig is the third representative from
            North West Germany. A charge against Borussia will be laid before
            the North- Rhine Westphalian association.“

            <div>Michallek‘s trip to Berlin</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            The BVB team gave a hearty welcome to a coal dust-covered Max
            Michallek on the concourse of the main station in Berlin having
            travelled to the city to take on BSV 92 Berlin in a championship
            game. Michallek had overslept and missed the team’s early morning
            departure and so was left with no other choice but to hop aboard a
            coal train heading to Berlin. During the trip Michallek took his
            turn to stoke the fires in the cab and so ended his trip typically
            caked in coal dust. There was a tricky moment to overcome at the
            border controlled by Russian guards but Michallek was able to use
            gestures to convince them that he was a footballer leading them to
            wave him on as they recognised him from descriptions given to them
            by the official party who had passed the checkpoint hours earlier.
            The game was eventually won with a nice clean Max Michallek
            outstanding in a 5-0 triumph which saw the Olympic stadium handed
            back to Germany from the allied forces for the first time.

          <div class="content">
            The board of BVB today came to a momentous decision at its meeting
            at the ”Wildschutz“, Oesterholzstrasse 60. From this coming Friday
            forward there will be public gatherings each week in order to
            involve members more in sporting matters. It is proposed that at
            these meetings the captains of the men’s teams would announce
            their selections for the upcoming games so that they could be
            discussed and debated. Should any disagreements over selection
            arise, the board would hold the casting vote.
