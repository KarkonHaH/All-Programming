            <div>Board sacks Eppenhoff / Eppenhoff sacks board</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Quite extraordinary developments today in the matter of coach
            Hermann Eppenhoff’s sacking in the aftermath of the game against
            Inter Milan. Following an intervention by Eppenhoff’s lawyer, the
            entire board resigned en masse declaring that all posts on the
            board were up for election. The reason? A clear infringement of
            protocol at the board elections of 27/1/1964. The theory being
            that that infringement meant that president Kurt Schoienherr was
            never really elected and so the sacking of Eppenhoff was not in
            his thrall. The feted coach will take training again tomorrow. On
            29/5/1964 an extraordinary general meeting will be held at the
            great hall at Hoechst AG to hold new elections to the board. That
            will bring to an end a drama the like of which German football has
            never seen. <br /><br />The apparent reason for Eppenhoff’s
            sacking after the Inter game had been unflattering comments by the
            coach towards members of the board. Eppenhoff is a much loved
            figure in Dortmund, the team having won the championship under him
            in 1963. Great victories in Europe against the likes of Lyn Oslo,
            Benfica and Dukla Prague followed while the one-time Schalke man
            has the total respect of the dressing room. That he had issues
            with certain members of the board had been rumoured for some time
            along the corridors of the club.

              Dortmund goes crazy: BVB beat Liverpool to win Cup Winners’ Cup
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <img src="photo/1960.jpg" />
            Hundreds of thousands thronged the streets of Dortmund this
            evening to witness the homecoming at the ”Neuen Markt“ (today
            known as Friedensplatz) of the victorious BVB team that beat
            Liverpool 2-1 to secure the club’s first European title. Goal
            scorers Held and Libuda were particularly feted but Tilkowski,
            Cyliax, Redder, Kurrat, Paul, Assauer, Schmidt, Sturm and Emmerich
            also received countless standing ovations from the manic crowd.
            Town mayor Dietrich Keuning welcomed the team home and for BVB
            president Steegman and coach Multhaup in turn thanked him for his
            comments. The Black n Yellows had gone into the game in Glasgow’s
            Hampden Park as big outsiders. <br /><br />The theory was that the
            team from Beatles City would be too strong but BVB were simply too
            clever and also won most of the crucial one on ones. Assauer,
            Sturm, Paul and Tilkowski were outstanding in a team of heroes.
            BVB had reached the Final with wins over La Valetta, Sofia and
            Atletico Madrid. They had qualified for the competition by winning
            the German (DFB) Cup the previous season with a 2-0 win over
            Alemannia Aachen. For the first time ever a German president had
            been present at the final.

            <div>'Emma' scores the ”Goal of the Century“</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Borussia Dortmund’s top scorer Lothar ”Emma“ Emmerich certainly
            focussed attention on himself by scoring a spectacular goal for
            Germany in a World Cup game against Spain. In the 39th minute,
            Emmerich charged onto a long ball from Overath down the left and
            drilled an unstoppable shot high into the corner of keeper Inbar’s
            net to make the score 1-1. The goal was instantly described by the
            assembled media as the ”Goal of the Century“. <br /><br />Uwe
            Seeler’s goal secured victory for the DFB eleven. It was Seeler
            who had begged coach Helmut Schoen to include Emmerich for the
            game. Emmerich was joined in the side by fellow BVB players Hans
            Tilkowski and Siggi Held.

            <div>Dog bites Rausch – Nigbur’s appointment with the iceman</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Games between BVB and Schalke 04 are always something special and
            sometimes events around the games are just as interesting. One
            such occasion came along in the 1968/69 meeting when a police dog
            got free from his handler and promptly chased towards the backside
            of Schalke’s Friedel Rausch. The dog had no muzzle on. There was a
            bite, a cry of pain! Rausch happily only sustained a flesh wound
            while a vet was called to confirm that the dog was none the worse
            for the incident either. In the early 70s Norbert Nigbur was
            between the sticks for Schalke. As his team went on the offensive
            against BVB, Nigbur wandered forward to the edge of his box.
            Seeing this, an ice-cream seller at the ”Rote Erde“ stadium crept
            onto the field in front of the Schalke goal before striding out to
            Nigbur to offer him an ice. It seemed to hit the spot!

            <div>A most entertaining ”Question Time“'</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            In the late 60s BVB enlisted the services of one Hermann Lindemann
            as their coach, a man whose vanity was only exceeded by his poor
            eyesight. This combination often led to his appearing on the
            side-lines without his much-needed spectacles. Below is the
            conversation that took place between Lindemann and one of his
            players at the end of a game: <br><br>Lindemann: Tell me, in the 85th
            minute, how come you allowed your man to stroll into the box
            unchallenged and have a shot on goal? Player: Because it was a
            penalty.
