            <div>A job for two men: Lattek and Sammer to rescue BVB</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <img src="photo/2000.jpg" />
            According to Kicker sports magazine, Udo Lattek’s first appearance
            at the BVB training ground at ”Rabenloh“ was like the arrival of
            an alien. Little wonder then the appointment of the renowned yet
            believed to have retired 65-year-old to the position of coach at
            BVB is pretty sensational news. At his side he will have the
            coaching novice, 32-year-old Matthias Sammer who would not
            complete his licence until two months later. Perhaps the job of
            pulling together a crisis-riddled team without a win in 12 games
            really is a job for two men. The two men have clearly defined
            roles. Udo Lattek, media savvy and a great motivator is charged
            with taking the pressure off the players while perfectionist and
            analyst Matthias Sammer will be responsible for tactics. The
            mission is accomplished. BVB take eight points from their last
            five games and climb to eleventh in the table. Udo Lattek calls it
            a day at the end of those stressful final weeks and returns to his
            role as a TV commentator. New boy Sammer takes the reigns alone
            moving forward.

            <div>BVB flotation: The future starts now</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            BVB have often been at the forefront of things on the field. They
            were the first club to become champions twice with exactly the
            same eleven; they were the first German club to win in Europe in
            1966, and the first Champions League winners in 1997. And now, in
            October 2000, off the field BVB once again take the lead becoming
            the first German Bundesliga club to float on the stock market. The
            opening price on the Frankfurt market was eleven Euros.
            <br /><br />This move was made possible following a decision taken
            at the annual general meeting on 28 November 1999. It was decided
            to re-create the club into a joint-stock company. The aim of this
            move and floating on the stock exchange is to strengthen the
            club’s finances which will allow, in turn, the club to compete
            internationally. BVB president Dr Gerd Niebaum described the
            club’s going public as its second Birthday adding, „If a club like
            BVB can mix it with the big boys in Europe not just for the next
            two or three years but over the next fifteen then this move can be
            viewed as a success.“

            <div>Heiko Herrlich critically ill</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            The whole of world football, not just BVB fans, are shocked to
            hear the news at a BVB press conference that Heiko Herrlich has
            been diagnosed as having a brain tumour. The striker had
            complained of impaired vision. Dr. Niebaum. Clearly very
            distressed, said ”We are so sad. It just goes to show that there
            are more important things than football, results and league
            positions. However, our medical team report that there is a good
            chance of Heiko making a full recovery and resuming his playing
            career.“ In the days that followed the announcement, BVB was
            inundated by faxes and e-mails from across the football globe
            expressing their good wishes for Heiko. Four months later Herrlich
            holds a press conference to say that thanks to the fine work of
            the doctors he had conquered the threat. He was effusive in his
            thanks to the club and particularly club doctor Dr. Preuhs who had
            always been at his side. On 3 July 2001, during a pre-season
            tournament in Kriens, Herrlich returns to BVB action.

              A glorious European night: Amoroso on fire against Milan
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Younger BVB fans could not believe their eyes, whilst old-timers
            recalled the amazing 5-0 win over Benfica in 1963. Sensationally,
            but utterly deservedly, Dortmund put AC Milan to the sword in the
            first leg of the UEFA Cup semi-final. The six-time European,
            three-time World champion club was simply swept away. Undoubted
            star of this historic evening was Marcio Amoroso with a hat trick
            (8th, 34th and 39th minutes). It was almost all over by half-time
            but just to be sure Heinrich added a fourth after 63 minutes. It
            was not just the result, but the manner of it that so impressed as
            the Italian legends were demolished with Amoroso, Ewerthon and
            Dede lighting up the evening for the 52,000 fans with wonderful
            football.
            <br /><br />The four-goal cushion was much needed for the return
            leg did not go so smoothly fourteen days later. Indeed, an Inzaghi
            penalty in time added on brought the home side to within a goal of
            levelling before Lars Ricken shot home to secure Borussia’s place
            in the Final in Rotterdam.

          <div class="content">
            <img src="photo/2000-2.jpg" />
            The day was 4 May 2002. The scene was set for a climactic finish
            to the 2001/02 season. Dortmund went into the last day a point
            ahead of Bayer Leverkusen and two ahead of Bayern. The final home
            game of the season against Werder Bremen was a mirror image of the
            highs and lows BVB fans had experienced all season. A shot against
            the bar by Amoroso, Werder taking the lead, other rivals taking
            control of their games early on to add to the pressure, then
            Koller’s equaliser, Addo hits the post, while on the side-lines
            Emerson warms up. Then Tiikuzu opted for the more difficult path
            when a goal seemed certain and only struck the woodwork.
            <br /><br />Sammer was quite convinced after the game ”that had
            that gone in there was no way we were going to come back again.“
            But on comes Ewerthon, who had joined the club during the season
            and made a great debut against St. Pauli. And here he did it
            again. People have since calculated that it was exactly 49 seconds
            after coming on that he fired home the winner on 74 minutes to
            prompt a wave of sound in the Westfalen stadium that had never
            before been experienced even in that less than quiet ground.

            <div>More development: The Westfalen stadium is closed in</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            The third phase of the redevelopment is now complete. All four
            corners of the Westfalen stadium are now in full use. Dortmund now
            has the most beautiful and biggest footballing ’temple‘ in all of
            Germany. The game against Werder Bremen (2-1 win) was watched by
            80,500 fans, the second biggest crowd in the history of the
            Bundesliga. On December 3 confirmation was finally received that
            the stadium would host four group matches, a quarter final and a
            semi-final of the 2006 World Cup. Dortmund president Dr Niebaum
            described this as a huge honour for the club. On January 30, 2004
            the stadium was packed to its capacity for the first time when
            Schalke 04 came to town for a game witnessed by 83,000. But these
            stadium developments cannot be paid for by BVB. The ground is
            leased to a property developer but any hope of ever buying back
            ownership is simply going to be beyond the club’s funds. In the
            spring of 2005 Borussia Dortmund only just escape bankruptcy.
            <br /><br />The fans experienced a roller coaster of success and
            failure in the years thereafter. With the cost of the squad
            necessarily halved, the team went through some dark times on the
            pitch too. At times relegation was a real possibility but
            generally the club ended up between 7th and 9th place.
            <br /><br />2007/08 was the low point when the club finished in
            13th spot. A significant reason for this poor showing was the
            considerable distraction of the German (DFB) Cup the final of
            which was reached for the first time since 1989.
