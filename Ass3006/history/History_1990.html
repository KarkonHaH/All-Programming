              Missed out by four mins – Stuttgart German champions in 92
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Borussia are in mourning. Right up until the 86th minute of the
            final day of the Bundesliga season it seemed that the Black n
            Yellows were going to end their 29 year wait for the German
            championship. But then a Guido Buchwald goal for VfB in their game
            against Leverkusen (resulting in a 2-1 win for VfB) turned BVB
            dreams to dust. The 30,000 BVB fans assembled on the Friedensplatz
            to watch the game against Duisburg were struck dumb. Having
            anticipated celebrating a championship win, they now had second
            place to, er, celebrate. So how did it come to this climax? Going
            into the 34th and final day BVB (in Duisburg), VfB Stuttgart (in
            Leverkusen) and Eintracht Frankfurt (in Rostock) all had a chance
            to win the title. Frankfurt suffered a defeat and so it was down
            to the other two to decide the destination of the title. A goal
            from Chapuisat gave BVB the lead after 10 minutes and they stayed
            ahead in their game from that point on. Meanwhile, with Bayer 04
            in the lead against VfB the Friedensplatz was optimistic, but then
            the equaliser in Leverkusen came on 41 minutes and then the
            winner. So Stuttgart, with Eike Immel in goal, were 1992
            Bundesliga champions.

            <div>Marriage proposal in front of 30,000</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Some 30,000 BVB fans today witnessed the oddest marriage proposal
            in Bundesliga history. The scene was set in the Friedensplatz in
            Dortmund town centre. Most had gathered there to see the last
            Borussia Dortmund game of the 91/92 season against MSV Duisburg
            but Jörg Enseling, BVB fan and master butcher, saw it as an
            opportunity to ask Tanja those special words, ”Will you marry
            me?“. Happily she was only too happy to scream into the microphone
            that she would indeed marry him. It was also young Tanja’s 20th
            birthday. Some birthday present, eh? The day would have been
            perfect if BVB had won the Bundesliga title, but alas, that was
            not to be.

              BVB expands the Westfalen stadium – Contract signed on a notable
              day
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Today, the 5th of May, marks the 29th anniversary of that win over
            Liverpool and today now also marks the birth of a joint project
            between the club and the town of Dortmund. Town mayor Guenter
            Samtlebe and BVB boss Dr Gerd Niebaum, witnessed by prominent
            guests, signed an undertaking to‘ loan‘ the stadium and its
            surrounds for a sum of one million a year to ”Westfalenstadion
            Dortmund GmbH & Co. KG“. This organisation has plans to expand the
            stadium. Initially the two main stands will be enlarged at a cost
            of over 60 million Deutschmarks with the two ends next up for
            expansion and renovation. The aim is to build a stadium with a
            capacity of 70,000. The council will not have to pay a penny for
            this. It is the second time that BVB have taken the lead in
            stadium building in Germany. In 1924, they almost totally
            self-financed the rebuilding of their then home ground ”Weisse
            Wiese“ into the „Borussia Sport Park“ to the tune of 50,000
            Reichmarks.

            <div>Tears upon tears: Flemming Povlsen departs</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            The Friedensplatz probably witnessed its most tear-filled day as
            bitter sweet emotions accompanied both BVB’s 2-0 win secure BVB
            the 1995 Bundesliga title and the final farewell of crowd
            favourite Flemming Povlsen from the ranks of BVB. Some 40 BVB fan
            clubs gathered on the stage to join Pur Harmonie and Karl-Heinz
            Bandosz (Heja BVB) to say goodbye to the Danish international who
            has had to retire due to injury. The 1992 European champion was
            presented with many gifts to mark his time at the club and BVB
            manager Michael Meier was very effusive in praise of the man who
            will now return to Denmark to live there with his family.

            <div>Fan-Meet against Manchester: English press horrified</div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            The Fan-Meet at the ”Alten Markt“ in connection with the BVB games
            against Manchester United in the Champions League semi-finals was
            today heralded a great success. Some 6,000 BVB and Man Utd fans
            mingled happily as, for the first time, the event went into the
            evening hours with the game being shown on a giant screen. The
            screen had been arranged to cater for the many Manchester fans
            that had travelled without a ticket for the game. Highlight of the
            day was undoubtedly the appearance of Man Utd legend Bobby
            Charlton in the afternoon. Charlton urged everyone to enjoy the
            game in a spirit of friendship and his wishes were granted. Even
            UEFA’s observers were impressed. It was simply a great example of
            the warm welcome Dortmund provides its football fan visitors. It
            was especially pleasing that the event went so well because in the
            build-up to the game the English press had expressed horror at the
            prospect of an ”invitation to fight“. The Man Utd board are now
            urgently looking into the possibility of arranging something
            similar for the return leg in two weeks’ time.
