            Tumultuous scenes played out last evening in connection with the
            foundation of ”Ballspiel-Verein Borussia 1909“ [Ball Sports Club
            “Borussia 1909”] in the north east of Dortmund. Over 40 members of
            the youth Catholic Holy Trinity, Flurstrasse, met at 1900 in the
            ”Zum Wildschutz“ restaurant at Oesterholzstrasse 60, with the
            intention of founding ”BVB“ partly out of a love for sport but
            also out of anger at chaplain Hubert Dewald who is responsible for
            youth affairs in the trinity. Speaker and vice-president of the
            fledgling club, Franz Jacobi, announced, ”I have been a member of
            the Trinity Youth since 1902 and since 1906 we have been playing
            on the ”Weissen Wiese“. We footballers have been systematically
            attacked and defamed by our church since 1906. We can no longer
            put up with this. This club is absolutely necessary.“ Father
            Dewald tried to intervene personally to stop the founding without
            success. Both he and his followers were denied entry, at times
            forcibly. However, his appearance did see some 20 rebels back down
            and so just ”18“ true Borussen took part in the foundation. By the
            way, the name ”Borussia“ is leant from the Borussia brewery on the
            street Steiger Strasse. The club colours: blue and white stripes
            with a red inset, black shorts. The new club will now seek
            admittance to the West German FA.

            BVB register their first binding constitution before the courts
            <br /><br />The Ballspiel-Verein ”Borussia 1909“, Dortmund, a
            member of the West German FA, the German FA and the German
            Athletics Association, today registered its first club
            constitution.<br /><br />The club is committed to the betterment
            of the people through the playing of football and other physical
            games. Contained, amongst other things, in the constitution is the
            following rule: <br /><br />To miss a competitive game without
            good reason will incur a 1 Reichsmark fine. Later arrival, again
            when no good reason provided, incurs 50% of that sum as fine.
            <br /><br />Leaving the field without permission of the team
            leader will incur a 2RM fine. The team leader’s decision is to be
            respected at all times. Players who choose not to follow his
            instructions can be excluded by him from games. It is specifically
            not allowed to smoke during games. <br /><br />This last point is
            of particular significance in the light of recent events. The
            association magazine ”Körper und Geist” [Body and Soul] recently
            reported that ”We take this opportunity to make grass sport
            associations aware that they ought to give some time to observing
            their own referees. Only recently, this correspondent witnessed a
            competitive fixture where the referee calmly observed proceedings
            whilst puffing on a cigar. What sort of an impression does this
            make on players and spectators alike.“

          </div>
          <div class="content">
            The first team of BVB today played a home game on the ”Weissen
            Wiese“ against VfB Dortmund. A pacey game finished with a 1-0 win
            for Borussia. Wienke scored the winning goal however joy at the
            win was short-lived. The referee, made aware of the problem by VfB
            players, had a tape measure brought from the nearby home of farmer
            Wubbecke in order to measure up both goals. One goal was 22cm too
            small and so the game was annulled.

          <div class="content">
            The board of BVB today came to a momentous decision at its meeting
            at the ”Wildschutz“, Oesterholzstrasse 60. From this coming Friday
            forward there will be public gatherings each week in order to
            involve members more in sporting matters. <br /><br />It is
            proposed that at these meetings the captains of the men’s teams
            would announce their selections for the upcoming games so that
            they could be discussed and debated. Should any disagreements over
            selection arise, the board would hold the casting vote.
