            Dr Werner Wilms and the board today received an unexpected visit
            from a delegation of players ahead of the championship game
            against Karlsruher SC. The reason? The board had cunningly chosen
            precisely this moment to advise Erich Schanko in writing that they
            were not inclined to extend his contract at the club. Preissler
            and the players were not happy about this and quite simply set the
            board the following ultimatum: <br /><br />”If Erich’s contract is
            not extended, then we will not be taking the field today!“ Not
            unexpectedly, Erich duly got his contract extension.

            Following their win in the final of the 1956 championship Borussia
            travelled back to Dortmund by train drunk with joy but still wide
            awake. The players‘ wives were on board too, of course. But the
            then board did not find that fact so obvious, because the decision
            was taken for the players to be presented to their fans without
            their loved ones. The players rallied around Max Michallek and
            stood their ground. In turn the board sought to get their own way
            by engineering it so that the players were all at the front of the
            carriage, the wives further back. The intention was that the
            carriage containing the wives would be secretly unhooked off the
            back of the train before it arrived in Dortmund. The players again
            saw through this manoeuvre and quickly spread themselves amongst
            the ladies to thwart the very strange plan.

            Bobby Charlton, one of the most important figures in World
            football in this century, was simply the highlight of the 16th
            fan-gathering on the ”Alten Markt“. Ahead of the Champions League
            game between BVB and Man Utd (1-0 to United) he called for the
            fans of both teams to ensure that the night would be a celebration
            of European football. His first visit to Dortmund, albeit as a
            substitute, was back in November 1956. It was the return leg of
            the European Cup tie between the same two clubs and took place at
            the „Rote Erde“ stadium. BVB keeper Kwiatowski has entered the
            annals of football history as the ’Hero of Manchester‘ for his
            performance denying the likes of Taylor and co. The return leg in
            Dortmund ended goalless. Bobby Charlton was one of the few to
            survive the Munich air crash on 6 February 1958. 21 people lost
            their lives that day on the runway at Munich airport.
            <br /><br />BVB won their first German championship in 1956 with a
            4-2 win over Karlsruher SC. Coach Helmut Schneider (who had
            replaced the legendary ”Bumbas“ Schmidt a year earlier saw his
            selection (Kwiatowski, Burgsmueller, Sandmann, Schlebrowski,
            Michallek, Bracht, Peters, Preissler, Kelbassa, Niepieklo and
            Kapitulski) justify his ideas and bring home the championship bowl
            to the heartland of football. The title secured entry into the
            next season’s European Cup for the first time. The following year,
            and with the same line-up, BVB repeated their championship win
            this time seeing off a Hamburg SV team including a young Uwe
            Seeler and Klaus Stuermer with a resounding 4-1 win.
