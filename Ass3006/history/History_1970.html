            Today saw the opening of what is surely Germany’s most beautiful
            football stadium with the occasion being marked with a friendly
            match between BVB and Schalke 04 (0-3) to raise funds for the
            impoverished BVB. Town mayor Guenter Samtlebe and BVB president
            did the honours in front of a capacity 54,000 crowd. The stadium
            has been built with the 1974 World Cup in mind. Following that it
            will be home to the current regional league side Borussia
            Dortmund. The stadium has cost 32 million marks to build with the
            council having contributed just six million, the rest of the
            funding coming from lottery, the FA and principally from the
            regional government of North-Rhine Westphalia. The project has
            attracted a lot of criticism with many raising doubts about the
            whether such money could not be better spent elsewhere. Dortmund
            has been given games between Scotland and Zaire, Bulgaria and
            Holland, Holland versus Sweden as well as a semi-final (which
            turned out to be Brazil v Holland).
            <br /><br />The first goal in the new stadium was scored by a
            young lady by the name of Margarethe Schaeferhoff at 18:18 in a
            game between TBV Mengede and VfB Waltrop. Officially, by the way,
            today’s opening game was unofficial because the German FA (DFB)
            will officially open the stadium by staging an international
            between Germany and Hungary there in two weeks’ time.

            <div>Zoltan‘s catching pigeons!</div>

          <div class="content">
            BVB’s midfield maestro Zoltan Varga will from now on be known as
            the champion pigeon catcher following his antics at a BVB home
            game in the Westfalen stadium. Cat-like he crept up on a pigeon
            which had been commuting between the corner flag and the BVB box
            for much of the first half. Selling the bird a dummy, Varga
            pounced and was soon holding the pigeon trophy-like into the sky
            to resounding applause from the stands. The international handed
            the bird to groundsman Walter Betzer who duly released the pigeon
            outside the walls of the stadium.

            Borussia Dortmund officially parted company with their coach Otto
            Rehagel this morning. BVB suffered a 12-0 defeat at the hands of
            Borussia Moenchengladbach at Düsseldorf’s Rhein stadium yesterday
            in their last game of the season. Borussia played so woefully that
            one’s heart went out to reserve keeper Peter Endrulat between the
            sticks. This result almost contrived to win Gladbach the
            Bundesliga but 1FC Cologne’s 5-0 win over St Pauli was enough to
            spare the Bundesliga an almighty scandal. <br /><br />Rehhagel had
            been in charge since June 1976. In a proper cloak and daggers
            move, he had been coaxed away from a job at SV Werder Bremen and,
            having taken over from Horst Buhtz, taken BVB into the Bundesliga
            with home and away wins over 1FC Nuremberg.
