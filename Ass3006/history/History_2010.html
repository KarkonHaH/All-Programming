            Whilst off the field Hans-Joachim Watzke and his team led the club
            to financial stability and wealth clearing some 126 million Euros
            worth of debt, on the field things were progressing well, too.
            Jürgen Klopp arrived to give the team a new impetus and purpose.
            Following the narrow defeat to Bayern in the Cup Final a door was
            opened into European competition for the first time since 2003.
            Klopp so impressed with his character and his desire to play
            ’full-throttle‘ football. And boy did his team buy into the
            mantra, particularly at home where in 2008/09 the team remained
            unbeaten for the first time in almost 20 years. 59 points meant
            that UEFA Cup qualification was missed by the smallest of margins.
            <br /><br />The new philosophy, to build around young, hungry
            players worked from the start. The team played its way into the
            hearts of football fans across Europe. That 5th place finish was
            followed by a Bundesliga win with the youngest ever side to take
            that title, the seventh in the club’s history. On May 14 2011 DFB
            president Dr Reinhard Rauball handed Roman Weidenfeller the
            championship trophy and a whole region swelled with pride.
            Dortmund celebrated that title like no other city before.

            The first Double in the club’s history sends the fans into a
            frenzy of ecstasy peaking in exhilarating fashion at the Final in
            Berlin.<br /><br />
            The final whistle saw players and fans alike melt into total joy.
            The BVB fans that had taken over the city in the build-up to the
            game dominated proceedings in the stadium, too. Their team, their
            champions were roared on as if the Signal Iduna Park had been
            transplanted to Berlin. <br /><br />Norbert Dickel’s naming of the
            team prompted wave upon wave of tumultuous noise around the
            Olympic stadium. And with just three minutes gone, an atmosphere
            that few present felt could have got better, just did as Shinji
            Kagawa gave BVB the lead to kick-start Black n Yellow
            celebrations. The Olympic stadium was rocking. <br /><br />The
            Bayern fans soon realised that only one team was going to be in
            control and so while Dortmund cheered, the Bavarian fans wept. The
            only time the game was anything like in doubt was a short period
            between the 25th and 41st minutes. The stadium held its breath as
            Weidenfeller charged out to stop Mario Gomez. <br /><br />But yes,
            it was a penalty, and Robben duly dispatched the ball into the net
            with Weidenfeller, unlike in the Bundesliga weeks earlier, beaten
            this time. <br /><br />A brief silence, then the passion, the
            noise, the support was back. If there is one thing BVB fans know
            how to do, it’s getting behind the team in adversity. With Bayern
            hinting at taking control, the Black n Yellow masses refused to
            accept that fact and they were rewarded with a second BVB goal.
            From then on, the euphoria was frenzied and continuous as people
            embraced, wept and laughed celebrating a historic, mad result.
            <br /><br />When Franck Ribery made it 2-4 Borussia, both players
            and fans alike, scarcely wavered. Mitch Langerak, replacing the
            injured Weidenfeller was imperious, Robert Lewandowski’s hat-trick
            simply topping off a magical season for the Pole and Mats Hummels
            who, having scored a penalty was the first to charge towards the
            fans at the final whistle; this was a game that was only ever
            going to be won by one team. <br /><br />For many BVB fans it was
            hard to take in. Five goals, and five consecutive wins over
            Bayern. Bundesliga and Cup winners, and a team full of records.
            All remarkable as was the party that was now starting and went on
            and on and on.
