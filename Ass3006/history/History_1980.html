            On 28/8/1984 Andre Egli was sent from the field during a game
            between BVB and FC Uerdingen. Today he was cleared of all charges.
            A video taken by the council at the game was presented to the DFB
            by BVB manager Tippenhauer prompted this reversal. It was the
            first time that the DFB had allowed outside evidence into such
            proceedings. Egli: “The council video clearly confirmed what I had
            said all along, namely that I didn’t foul anyone.” The council was
            taping the game in connection with celebrations to mark the 75th
            anniversary of BVB and just happened to capture the relevant
            incident allowing BVB to use the footage to their advantage.

              Black n Yellow Friedensplatz – Cup winning BVB roared home

            The recently re-named Friensplatz hosted its first sporting
            highlight today when some 250,000 fanatical BVB fans welcomed home
            a cavalcade bringing their heroes fresh from winning the Cup. The
            occasion was put together by the council and BVB following BVB’s
            victory over the favoured Werder Bremen in Berlin. The ”Hero of
            Berlin“ with two goals in the 4-1 win was Norbert Dickel who
            played with a serious injury; Mill and Lusch were the other
            goalscorers. This occasion follows on from the now traditional and
            highly successful Fan-Meets which began in 1987 in connection with
            BVB’s European games and is another example of how the club and
            council are working together so well.
