            stadium is the epicentre. This is where all of BVB's energy is
            released. We enjoy a special place in the hearts of all our fans:

            and the bad for more than 100 years. We are determined to give
            them something back. Be it through sporting success, or through
            our promise to remain true to our traditional ethos and be as
            we've always been: sincere, candid, battling and grounded in the
            values of Dortmund â€“ the city and its people.
